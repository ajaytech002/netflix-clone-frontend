## Setup

This is the frontend of the Netflix Clone frontend, deveoped using React. This app was created using `create-react-app` and `react-router-dom`.

1. [Install git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2. [Install visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. Create a new project in github.

Use the same name as the react project which we will be creating using the `create-react-app` script. Don't create a README.md file. Just create a .gitignore and a LICENSE if necessary.

After the projet has been created in github, get the git clone url. For example, in our case it will be `https://github.com/ajaytech002/netflix-clone-frontend.git`.

3. Clone the project into your computer.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ajaytech002/netflix-clone-frontend.git
```

4.  Create the react app using the following command:

```bash
npx create-react-app netflix-clone-frontend
```

Run this command inside the same directory that you used to run the previous command. Do NOT enter into the directory which was created when you cloned the repository.

A new README.md will be created by the `create-react-script`. This will contain the instructions to run the react app using the `npm start` command.

5. Remove the following files:

We will have to do a little bit of a clean-up to remove unwanted files for now. This is to ensure that the setup directory stays clean and you will not be confused with unnecessary files.

```bash
📁 src
 Ⳑ 🗎 App.test.js
 Ⳑ 🗎 logo.svg
 Ⳑ 🗎 reportWebVitals.js
 Ⳑ 🗎 setupTests.js
```
